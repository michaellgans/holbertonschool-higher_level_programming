Hi there! <br>
These are my notes I took while I was working through his project. <br>
If you need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to me on slack. <br>

## Modules

When using modules in python, the syntax is name_of_module.function_name()

### Random

>- randint() - returns a random integer within the range given.

## If/Else Statement Syntax

```
if statement:
   do action
elif statement:
   do action
else:
   do action
```

## For Loops Syntax

```
for x in range(start, stop):
   do action
```

## FYSK (Functions You Should Know)

>- `hex()` = Takes in a number and returns the hexidecimal number.
>- `chr()` = Takes in a number and returns the ASCII character.
