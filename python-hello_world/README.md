# Python-Hello_World
Hello everyone!
These are the notes I've taken while doing this project.  
Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need assistance.

## How to use the `print()` statement:

>- General Use: `print("This will print!")
>- Quotes: single vs double doesn't matter, just make them match.
>- Special Character Escaping: use `\` to ensure a special character is printed.
>- Printing Varaibles: `print(VAR)` works just fine

## How to pass a variable into a print statement:

>- Remember to use `print(f"The variable is: {VAR}")` when passing in a variable like a number ðŸ˜‰

## How to format data inside a print statement:

>- There are two different ways to do this, but it's typically referred to as f-string formatting.
>- the `.2` indicates that you want two decimal places and the `f` indicates that the data type is float.
```
print(f"{VAR:.2f}")
```
