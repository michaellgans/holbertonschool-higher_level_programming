# Classes

## Object Oriented Programming
- Procedure-oriented - a program designed around functions.  
- Object Oriented - combine data and functionality and wrap it into an "object"
- Class - creates a new "type"
    - Just like how int is a data type of a variable
- Objects - creates a new instance of a class
    - Just like how x is a variable
    - Stores data using varaibles that "belong" to the object.
    - Attribute of a class.
- Fields - variable is called a "field"
    - Attribute of a class.
    - Can belong to the object or the class itself.
        - Instance Variables - belong to object
        - Class Variables - belong to class
- Methods - functions of a class vs functions that are independent.
    - Attribute of a class.

## The `Self`
- Class methods have the class before the function, like `class.function()` but no variable is given.  Python calls the variable `self`.

## Class Syntax
